##  MD5 Cryptographic Hash Function - Hardware and Software

The main idea of this project is to implement a system where:

- The most complexity part is implemented on hardware (MD5 hash function)
- The interaction is implemented on software

To explore the complexity and to compare two approaches:

We developer a script to implement MD5 in C and compare the performance of three approaches:

- All on software
- All on hardware
- MD5 on hardware and interaction on software


## Requirements

- Vivado 2019.2
- Vitis 
- Nexys4 Digilent Xilinx (FPGA)
